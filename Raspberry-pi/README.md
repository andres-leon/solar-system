# So What's All This?!?!

This folder contains the code that runs in the Pi. 

## Python
These are python scripts in my home folder (/home/pi/) and are direclty or indireclty triggered by the Raspberry's CRON daemon. The scripts that start by CRON are found in the file crontab_contents.txt. Other scripts are triggered or started by these scripts.
